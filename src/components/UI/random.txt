I heard from Alan I am not getting promoted. But since last year I am eligible for promotion

I have experience of almost 3 years now

When I joined, being a B.Tech. graduate, my compensation was not at par with MTECh graduates. But I believe I have put equal efforts in my work. 

I have done all the work assigned to me diligently. I want to highlight my chatbot work where I had to come up with solutions single handedly and implement them.

I have maintained good ratings every year

Now, I want to know your feedback so that I can improve myself
